# Bank Management

I decided to develop an integrated banking application with the help of python.exe module with MySql connectivity.
The banking module offers easy access to the details of all customers with the options of adding, deleting and updating them.
It can also display the account details sorted by customer name, account number or bank balance. 
Transactions can be done by crediting and debiting money.

The Main Menu consists of 8 options:

Option 1 be used to create a new account by providing the further asked details correctly. 
Option 2 can be used to display the record of all existing users & sort by the mentioned account details. 
Option 3 can be used to search for a particular account holder by his/her registered account number. 
Option 4 is used to update the details of an existing user. 
Option 5 is used to close/delete an account from the bankâ€™s database. 
Option 6 handles all kinds of transactions the user can perform. 
Option 7 can be used to get a Mini-Statement of an account, containing the details of all transactions performed by the user in the form of a pdf file.
Option 8 can be used to exit the application.
